# 🔍 Why Val Accuracy > Train Accuracy: Complete Guide

## 📊 Your Current Situation

```
Epoch 6:
  Train Accuracy: 89.29%
  Val Accuracy:   93.46%
  Difference:     +4.17% ← ABNORMAL!
```

**This should NOT happen in normal circumstances.**

## 🚨 Root Causes (Ranked by Likelihood)

### **1. DATA LEAKAGE (80% probability)** 

#### **Type A: Same Video in Multiple Splits**
```
Problem: Video frames split randomly, not by video ID
Example:
  - video_001 has 100 frames
  - Frames 1-80 go to training
  - Frames 81-100 go to validation
  - Model sees same person/scene in both splits!
```

**How to detect:**
```bash
python scripts/verify_no_leakage.py
```

**Solution:**
- Split by VIDEO ID before extracting frames
- Your code already does this in `prepare_dataset.py` lines 135-147
- **BUT**: Need to verify it was actually run correctly

---

#### **Type B: Identity/Person Leakage**
```
Problem: Same person appears in different videos across splits
Example:
  - Person A in video_001 → Training
  - Person A in video_045 → Validation
  - Model recognizes facial features, not deepfake artifacts
```

**How to detect:**
- Check if using datasets like FaceForensics++ or Celeb-DF
- These datasets have same people across multiple videos
- Need identity-aware splitting (complex)

**Solution:**
- Use diverse dataset sources
- Accept some identity overlap (minor issue)
- Focus on artifact detection, not face recognition

---

#### **Type C: Temporal/Sequential Leakage**
```
Problem: Consecutive frames are nearly identical
Example:
  - Frame 500 at t=16.66s → Training
  - Frame 501 at t=16.70s → Validation
  - Only 0.04 seconds apart!
```

**Solution:**
- Sample frames with larger temporal gap (every 10th frame)
- Your code does this: `frame_skip = config['preprocessing']['frame_skip']`

---

### **2. AUGMENTATION ASYMMETRY (10% probability)**

```python
# Training: Heavy augmentation makes it HARDER
train_transforms = [
    HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),        # Flips faces
    ColorJitter(p=0.5),           # Changes colors
    RandomRotation(15),           # Rotates images
    GaussianBlur(p=0.3),          # Adds blur
    RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.5)
]

# Validation: No augmentation = EASIER
val_transforms = [
    Resize(224),
    Normalize()
]
```

**Effect:** Train accuracy artificially lowered by 1-2%

**How to detect:**
```bash
python scripts/diagnose_val_acc_issue.py
# Check Test 1: AUGMENTATION ANALYSIS
```

**Solution:**
- This is actually GOOD! It prevents overfitting
- Gap of 1-2% is healthy
- Gap of 4%+ indicates other issues

---

### **3. VALIDATION SET TOO SMALL/EASY (5% probability)**

```
Problem: Not enough validation videos for reliable estimate
Your dataset: 974 videos total
If val_ratio = 0.10 → ~97 videos
If val_ratio = 0.05 → ~49 videos ← TOO SMALL!
```

**Statistics Issue:**
- Small validation set = high variance
- Might randomly contain "easy" samples
- Not representative of true performance

**How to check:**
```bash
python scripts/verify_no_leakage.py
# Look at "DATA DISTRIBUTION" section
```

**Solution:**
- Use ≥15% for validation (≥146 videos)
- Current recommendation: 70/15/15 train/val/test split

---

### **4. BATCH NORMALIZATION BEHAVIOR (3% probability)**

```python
# Training mode:
model.train()
# BatchNorm uses CURRENT batch statistics
# Mean/Std varies per batch → noisy → slightly lower accuracy

# Evaluation mode:
model.eval()
# BatchNorm uses RUNNING AVERAGE statistics
# More stable → cleaner → slightly higher accuracy
```

**Effect:** Explains 0.5-1% difference, NOT 4%+

**How to test:**
```python
# In diagnose_val_acc_issue.py
# Test 2: MODEL BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
```

**Solution:**
- This is normal behavior
- Not the primary cause if gap > 2%

---

### **5. DROPOUT REGULARIZATION (2% probability)**

```python
# Training:
model.train()
# Dropout randomly disables neurons → harder learning

# Validation:
model.eval()
# All neurons active → better performance
```

**Effect:** Max 1-2% difference

**Solution:**
- Normal and expected
- Helps prevent overfitting

---

### **6. LABEL NOISE (< 1% probability)**

```
Problem: Training labels have errors
Example:
  - video_042.mp4 labeled "fake" but actually "real"
  - Confuses model during training
  - Validation has correct labels
```

**How to detect:**
- Manually review misclassified samples
- Check data source quality

**Solution:**
- Use high-quality datasets
- Verify labels before training

---

## 🔬 Diagnostic Tools

### **Tool 1: Verify No Leakage**
```bash
python scripts/verify_no_leakage.py
```

Checks:
- ✅ Proper folder structure (train/val/test)
- ✅ No video overlap between splits
- ✅ Mapping files exist

---

### **Tool 2: Comprehensive Diagnosis**
```bash
python scripts/diagnose_val_acc_issue.py
```

Runs 5 tests:
1. Augmentation analysis
2. Model behavior (train vs eval mode)
3. Data distribution check
4. Detailed video leakage check
5. Sample prediction comparison
